Our work at AMRC was made possible thanks to the outpouring of support from the lionfish control, young entrepreneurship, and maker-hacker community. We are especially indebted to the following individuals, who by their sponsorship and mentorship have given us the runway to pursue dreams of marine conservation, technology for social good, and economic diversification and redevelopment of America's middle class--dreams which otherwise would have been intractable. To our sponsors and advisors, thank you, and thank you again.

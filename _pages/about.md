# Out of the Dorm Room
Founded in early 2017 by a group of engineering students out of forms at MIT, Princeton University, Olin College and Cornell University, we began as a hacker-maker project to build a drone to hunt invasive lionfish. As the team accelerated its development, however, it realized that the scope of the problem and the magnitude of its devastation required more than a hobbyist effort to have an impact. It was out of that realization that AMRC grew until a tech startup, still committed to its original social mission, but now equipped with the resources and energy of an early stage tech startup. What was originally an exercise in hardware hacking had grown into a commitment to leverage everything a scrappy but driven team of young engineers had to offer. 

# Guiding Principles
We are to our core a values-driven organization. In our work, we are guided by a handful--but a salient handful--of driving principles:

### Rethinking Problem Domains
In pursuing a niche--and in the view of this team, neglected--problem, we hold strongly the view that our industry has far too frequently misprioritized its talents and resources to relatively insignificant problems. While a team of fresh college grads might not be the one to prove them wrong, we'll certainly try: we intend to provide a positive example of bringing high tech to real problems, and hopefully do our part in redirecting the energies and resources of our nation's best and brightest to domains taht really matter.

### Democratizing the World of High Technology
Certainly reaching beyond the breadth of the wide-eyed new grads that comprise the team, but also certainly dear to our mission as a team is the belief that most communities in America have not received their fair share of the joys and wonders of the tech revolution. Indeed, with tech talent increasingly concentrated in a handful of cities around the country, the dynamics and populations, talent, and reward have led to an inefficient and unjust distribution of access to education and employment, especially in the fields that are the fastest growing. At AMRC, we hope to do our part in attracting the very highest caliber of talent to Pensacola to build great technology and grow alongside the community that we have come--very rapidly--to cherish.

### Responsible Engineering and Product Lifecycle 
At AMRC we take extreme care to ensure that the technologies that we develop, however effective, are only applied to productive causes. Seeing far too many risks and past instances of abuse of emerging technologies, we consider ourselves fully responsible for the usage of our technology and as such, commit ourselves to designing safe systems with zero collateral impact on our reefs and oceans, all while guaranteeing that our technology will only be used by honest, ethical partners.
